# Web Playback #

This lab is intended for exploring Media Services. It consists of an ASP.NET MVC web application that lists and provides a player for the media assets that have [On Demand Origin Locators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/hh974308.aspx) associated with them -- that is, assets which are available for streaming from within your Media Service.
